When open up the server rest api and the server manager on the instance, make sure you add .6443

Providing a link for the test:
* I believe the server needs to actually be running, look for details on how long it should be running for
* Make sure that the external IP is updated with the duck dns

The link to provide for if your opening it outside of the instance:
